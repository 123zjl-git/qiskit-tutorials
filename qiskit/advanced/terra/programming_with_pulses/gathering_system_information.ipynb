    "# Obtaining information about your `backend`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Note: All the attributes of the backend are described in detail in the [Qiskit Backend Specifications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03452.pdf). This page reviews a subset of the spec._\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming a quantum computer at the microwave pulse level requires more information about the device than is required at the circuit level. A quantum circuit is built for an abstract quantum computer -- it will yield the same quantum state on any quantum computer (except for varying performance levels). A pulse schedule, on the other hand, is so specific to the device, that running one program on two different backends is not expected to have the same result, even on perfectly noiseless systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a basic example, imagine a drive pulse `q0_X180` calibrated on qubit 0 to enact an $X180$ pulse, which flips the state of qubit 0. If we use the samples from that pulse on qubit 1 on the same device, or qubit 0 on another device, we do not know what the resulting state will be -- but we can be pretty sure it won't be an $X180$ operation. The qubits are each unique, with various drive coupling strengths. If we have specified a frequency for the drive pulse, it's very probable that pulse would have little effect on another qubit, which has its own resonant frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we have motivated why information from the backend may be very useful at times for building Pulse schedules. The information included in a `backend` is broken into three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Configuration**: static backend features\n",
    " - **Properties**: measured and reported backend characteristics\n",
    " - **Defaults**: default settings for the OpenPulse-enabled backend\n",
    " \n",
    "which are each covered in the following sections. While all three of these contain interesting data for Pulse users, the defaults are _only_ provided for backends enabled with OpenPulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you'll need to do is grab a backend to inspect."
